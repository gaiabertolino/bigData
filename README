# Big Data Project

This project was developed as part of a degree coursework exam for the course of models and Techniques for Big Data during the first year of my Master's degree in Computer Engineering.


The project features a Python-based interface, with data processing facilitated through the Streamlit library. This enables the visualization of information extracted from a vast dataset concerning air flights, necessitating the utilization of specific big data techniques.
