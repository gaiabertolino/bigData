The ensuing project has been completed as the culminating work for the course titled "Models and Techniques for Big Data," offered during the initial year of the master's program in computer engineering at the University of Calabria. It features a Python-based interface, with data processing facilitated through the Streamlit library. This enables the visualization of information extracted from a vast dataset concerning air flights, necessitating the utilization of specific big data techniques.
